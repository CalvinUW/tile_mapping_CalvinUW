        This map displays several custom made basemaps and layers depicting the area of Seattle, Washington. 
        The first layer is a custom made brown basemap that depicts the city of Seattle with varying shades of brown and tan.
        The second layer uses a generic light colored basemap from Mapbox, and shows the name and location of public art installations found across the city of Seattle.
        The third layer combines the brown basemap of layers one and the art data from layer two to show the public art installations of Seattle with a brown basemap.
        Finally, the last layer depicts the city of Seattle with a custom environmental-themed basemap, made in support of environmental protection.

        This map and the layers/basemaps contained in it were created by Calvin Standaert as part of a project in the University of Washington's 2023 Winter quarter of GEOG458 taught by Professor Bo Zhao.
